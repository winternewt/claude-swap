"""Cooperate with Claude Code's own advisory locks while mutating its files.

Claude Code guards its OAuth token refresh with the npm ``proper-lockfile``
package, and its ``~/.claude.json`` writes with the same mechanism on the
config file. The protocol (verified against the 2.1.218 bundle):

- The lock artifact is a **directory**; ``mkdir`` atomicity is the mutex.
- The refresh path takes **two** locks, in order: the primary
  ``<config-home>/.oauth_refresh.lock``, then the legacy
  ``<config-home>.lock`` (``~/.claude.lock``) kept for compatibility with
  external tools. Both run ``stale: 60000, update: 5000`` — a credential
  lock is stale only past **60s**, and live holders touch every 5s. On a
  contended legacy lock Claude Code releases the primary and retries.
- The config lock (``~/.claude.json.lock``) keeps the older defaults:
  stale after 10s, touched every 5s.
- Claude Code retries a held credentials lock 5 times with 1-2s jittered
  sleeps before giving up, so briefly holding it is fully cooperative.

Holding these locks while swapping credentials closes the one real race with a
running Claude Code: its refresh reads credentials, refreshes over the network,
and saves — all under both credential locks — so a swap landing inside that
window would be overwritten by the refreshed old-account token (and the
just-taken backup would keep a pre-rotation refresh token). Under the lock,
Claude Code's own double-checked re-read sees the swapped (non-expired)
credential and aborts the refresh instead.

References (claude-code 2.1.218 bundle): the ``uKi`` lock-options helper
(``lockfilePath: join(dir, ".oauth_refresh.lock"), stale: 60000, update:
5000``) and ``CKi`` (dual acquisition, legacy released-on-contention with
``tengu_oauth_refresh_legacy_lock_contended`` telemetry).
