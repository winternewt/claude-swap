"""Weekly usage pace (issue #125).

A weekly window is "ahead of pace" when the account has used more of it than
the fraction of the weekly reset cycle that has elapsed so far — e.g. 40% used
at the 20%-through-the-week mark. Applies only to weekly windows (``seven_day``
and every ``scoped`` per-model window); the 5h window is excluded because it
resets too fast for pace to mean anything (it starts "ahead of pace" almost by
definition early in the window, and the store's poll floor of ~3 minutes,
drifting to ~10 minutes when idle, is a large fraction of a 5h window but
negligible against a week — see issue #125 discussion).

``compute_pace`` is a pure function: it consumes an already-fetched window
dict and the snapshot's ``fetched_at``, never fetches anything itself, and has
no influence on poll cadence (that stays entirely in ``poll_policy``). Elapsed
time is measured against ``fetched_at`` rather than wall-clock ``now()``, so a
snapshot served stale (last-good data re-served after a failed refetch) is
evaluated against the clock it was actually measured at.
