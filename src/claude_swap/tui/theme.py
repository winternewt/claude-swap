"""The "cswap-dark" Textual theme and shared color constants.

A subtle modern dark theme: neutral charcoal backgrounds in the VS Code
register, one warm terracotta accent (the same xterm-173 tone printer.py has
always used for the CLI — a deliberate nod to Claude Code's orange, used
sparingly), and desaturated severity colors so usage bars read calmly on a
dark background. Deliberately *not* a wholesale copy of any other tool's
palette.
